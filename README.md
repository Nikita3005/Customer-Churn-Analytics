# Customer Churn Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior using a large-scale customer dataset. The objective is to identify key churn drivers and high-risk customer segments, and to translate analytical insights into a clear, interactive business dashboard.

The project covers the full analytics workflow — from data exploration and cleaning in Python to KPI-driven visualization in Power BI.

## Business Problem
Customer churn has a direct impact on revenue and long-term growth. Understanding **who is most likely to churn and why** helps organizations design targeted retention strategies and improve customer lifetime value.

## Dataset
- Size: 100,000+ customer records  
- Features include tenure, contract type, payment method, monthly charges, and churn status  
- Dataset used strictly for educational and analytical purposes  

**Note:** The raw dataset is not included in this repository due to size and licensing constraints.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Power BI:** DAX measures, KPI cards, interactive dashboards  
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis  

---

## Key Analysis & Insights
- Customers with **shorter tenure** exhibit significantly higher churn rates  
- **Month-to-month contracts** have the highest churn compared to long-term contracts  
- Churn risk decreases as customer tenure increases, highlighting early lifecycle risk  

---

## Dashboard Features
- KPI cards for total customers and churn rate  
- Churn analysis by tenure groups  
- Contract-wise churn comparison  
- Interactive slicers for contract type, payment method, and gender
